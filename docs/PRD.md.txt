# 📘 Product Requirements Document – EngageTrack AI

---

## 1. 🧭 Overview

**EngageTrack AI** is a full-stack SaaS analytics simulation platform built for showcasing modern DevOps, ML integration, and product lifecycle insights. It combines real churn prediction models with simulated user personas and AI-generated feature nudges — enabling recruiters and stakeholders to evaluate end-to-end product thinking, technical skills, and deployment maturity.

> 🔍 While the nudging system is rule-based and simulated, the churn prediction model is trained on a real customer behavior dataset using XGBoost.

# 📘 Product Requirements Document – EngageTrack AI

---

## 1. 🧭 Overview

**EngageTrack AI** is a full‐stack AI‐powered SaaS analytics simulation platform built to showcase product thinking, DevOps readiness, and applied machine learning. It blends **real churn prediction models** (using XGBoost) with **simulated nudging and lifecycle insights**, offering a recruiter-friendly and production-ready portfolio project.

> 🧠 The AI nudges are simulated using rule-based logic, while churn prediction is based on a real-world telecom customer dataset, augmented with an A/B `variant` flag.

---

## 2. 🎯 Product Goals

- ✅ Demonstrate real churn prediction using supervised ML (XGBoost)  
- ✅ Simulate AI-generated engagement nudges and lifecycle messaging  
- ✅ Provide system-wide analytics for engagement and churn behavior, including by A/B variant  
- ✅ Showcase DevOps pipeline and deployment via Docker + AKS  
- ✅ Deliver a recruiter-friendly, fully live demo for interviews
